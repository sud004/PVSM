Plant Village Small Model

This is the smaller dataset where I have used 10 categories to identfy the plant disease with 96% accuracy.
SInce I use RTX 4070 I cant increase buffer size and batch size from 200/8. If you have better GPU you can do so .
Techniques like EarlyStopping,ReduceLROnPlateau, LearningRateScheduler and Data augumentation is used .
